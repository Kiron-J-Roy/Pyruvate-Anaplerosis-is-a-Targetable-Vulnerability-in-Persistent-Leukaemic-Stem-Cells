Deregulated oxidative metabolism is a hallmark of leukaemia. While tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib have increased survival of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients, they fail to eradicate disease-initiating leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Whether TKI-treated CML LSCs remain metabolically deregulated is unknown. Using clinically and physiologically relevant assays, we generated multi-omics datasets that offer unique insight into metabolic adaptation and nutrient fate in patient-derived CML LSCs. We demonstrate that LSCs have increased pyruvate anaplerosis, mediated by increased mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1/2 (MPC1/2) levels and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) activity, when comparedin comparison to normal counterparts. While imatinib reverses BCR::ABL1-mediated LSC metabolic reprogramming, stable isotope-assisted metabolomics revealed reveals that deregulated pyruvate anaplerosis is not is unaffected by imatinib. Encouragingly, genetic ablation of pyruvate anaplerosis sensitises CML cells to imatinib. Finally, we demonstrate that MSDC-0160, a clinical orally-available MPC1/2 inhibitor, inhibits pyruvate anaplerosis and targets imatinib-resistant CML LSCs in robust pre-clinical CML models. Collectively these results highlight pyruvate anaplerosis as a persistent and therapeutically targetable vulnerability in imatinib-treated CML patient-derived samples.
